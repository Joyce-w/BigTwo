### Reflection
This project was made for Mintbean's Jr Web Dev Hackathon in which a week's time was given to create a card game.
Shortly after learning React, I was introduced to this Hackathon and thought it would be a great side project to challenge myself in a short amount of time as well as familiarizing myself with React. Having started late, I had doubts on whether I could writing the game logic in such a short period of time, but it turned out to be fine! :) 

- A problem that was frequently encountered was implementing logic that required state to be updated. 
- This led me to using functions and work-arounds to solve this problem. 
- This project could use additional hints/help during game play.
